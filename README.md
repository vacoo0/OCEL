## Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a system that can automatically generate object-centric event logs from instructional, tutorial, or how-to videos. In today's digital age, there is an abundance of video content available online, providing step-by-step instructions for various tasks and activities. However, it can be challenging to extract structured data from these videos to create event logs that capture the sequence of actions performed on specific objects.

By leveraging computer vision techniques and natural language processing, this project aims to bridge the gap between unstructured video content and structured event logs. The system will analyze the video frames to detect and track objects of interest, such as tools, equipment, or items being manipulated by the instructor in the video. It will also process the accompanying transcriptions to extract relevant textual instructions or annotations.

The extracted information will be used to construct object-centric event logs, which will capture the temporal order of actions performed on each object. These event logs can be invaluable for various applications, including process automation, knowledge extraction, or interactive tutorials.
